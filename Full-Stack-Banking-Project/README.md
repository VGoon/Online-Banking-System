# THE BANK Web App

THE BANK Web App is a web application that lets users bank online. 

Consumers of THE BANK app are able to create a bank account and with it, deposit, withdraw, and transfer money to their accounts and even others. 

For businesses looking to utilize THE BANK App, employees are able to keep track of all user accounts made, all bank accounts made, and keep record of a log of transactions that occur. They would also be able to lock and unlock accounts, and even delete accounts if the account is frozen and doesn't contain a balance.

## Technologies used throughout THE BANK APP:
- HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to display to the web page
- AJAX and JavaScript to send out server calls
- Java with Javalin to receive and respond to server calls
- JDBC and PostgreSQL to persist information
- JUnit, Mockito, and Log4j to test and log the process
- DAO design pattern to make sure the database stays intact

- Email a user when an account is approved

- Give the customers the choice to change their details
- Add the Front Controller Design Pattern to organize server calls
- Be able to scroll through and delete log messages as an employee
